# App Code Test

Welcome to the App Squads code test. We don't want you to spend  your free time building take home tests, and we feel live coding doesn't bring the best out in people. We prefer doing something familiar and more realistic to your normal woking day.
Here you will find a small React Native application written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) using the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) Framework.

You can clone this repository and browse on your local machine, run using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), or simply use the Github GUI to explore it's contents. We don't mind as long as you're familiar with the initial codebase, as this is the foundation for the test.

## Next steps

Please take some notes on the initial implementation as you browse through it, once you're ready provide your Github username to your recruiter the day before the Technical Test.

10 minutes before the technical begins, you will receive an invite to a [Private Github Repository](https://github.com/handbi/app-code-test), please accept the invite and be prepared to screenshare your browser with the [Github Pull Requests](https://github.com/handbi/app-code-test-reviews/pulls) before the technical begins.

## Pull Requests

The private repository will contain Pull Requests making changes to the codebase you've previously reviewed.

We've tried to keep the Pull Requests small and consise. You'll find that most of them can be improved upon, and these improvements will be the foundations for our discussions.

Don't worry if you can't spot any problems, interviews are stressful, we get it, take your time and remember to talk through your thinking with the Engineers, we'll help point you in the right direction if needed.


Best of luck! ðŸ¤ž
